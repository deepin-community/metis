gpmetis \- manual page for gpmetis 5.1.0
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gpmetis
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIgraphfile nparts\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
Required parameters
.TP
graphfile
Stores the graph to be partitioned.
.TP
nparts
The number of partitions to split the graph.
.IP
Optional parameters
.HP
\fB\-ptype\fR=\fIstring\fR
.IP
Specifies the scheme to be used for computing the k\-way partitioning.
The possible values are:
.TP
rb
\- Recursive bisectioning
.TP
kway
\- Direct k\-way partitioning [default]
.HP
\fB\-ctype\fR=\fIstring\fR
.IP
Specifies the scheme to be used to match the vertices of the graph
during the coarsening.
The possible values are:
.TP
rm
\- Random matching
.TP
shem
\- Sorted heavy\-edge matching [default]
.HP
\fB\-iptype\fR=\fIstring\fR [applies only when \fB\-ptype\fR=\fIrb]\fR
.IP
Specifies the scheme to be used to compute the initial partitioning
of the graph.
The possible values are:
.TP
grow
\- Grow a bisection using a greedy scheme [default for ncon=1]
.TP
random
\- Compute a bisection at random [default for ncon>1]
.HP
\fB\-objtype\fR=\fIstring\fR [applies only when \fB\-ptype\fR=\fIkway]\fR
.IP
Specifies the objective that the partitioning routines will optimize.
The possible values are:
.TP
cut
\- Minimize the edgecut [default]
.TP
vol
\- Minimize the total communication volume
.HP
\fB\-no2hop\fR
.IP
Specifies that the coarsening will not perform any 2\-hop matchings
when the standard matching fails to sufficiently contract the graph.
.HP
\fB\-contig\fR [applies only when \fB\-ptype\fR=\fIkway]\fR
.IP
Specifies that the partitioning routines should try to produce
partitions that are contiguous. Note that if the input graph is not
connected this option is ignored.
.HP
\fB\-minconn\fR [applies only when \fB\-ptype\fR=\fIkway]\fR
.IP
Specifies that the partitioning routines should try to minimize the
maximum degree of the subdomain graph, i.e., the graph in which each
partition is a node, and edges connect subdomains with a shared
interface.
.HP
\fB\-tpwgts\fR=\fIfilename\fR
.IP
Specifies the name of the file that stores the target weights for
each partition. By default, all partitions are assumed to be of
the same size.
.HP
\fB\-ufactor\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Specifies the maximum allowed load imbalance among the partitions.
A value of x indicates that the allowed load imbalance is 1+x/1000.
For ptype=rb, the load imbalance is measured as the ratio of the
2*max(left,right)/(left+right), where left and right are the sizes
of the respective partitions at each bisection.
For ptype=kway, the load imbalance is measured as the ratio of
max_i(pwgts[i])/avgpwgt, where pwgts[i] is the weight of the ith
partition and avgpwgt is the sum of the total vertex weights divided
by the number of partitions requested.
For ptype=rb, the default value is 1 (i.e., load imbalance of 1.001).
For ptype=kway, the default value is 30 (i.e., load imbalance of 1.03).
.HP
\fB\-ubvec\fR=\fIstring\fR
.IP
Applies only for multi\-constraint partitioning and specifies the per
constraint allowed load imbalance among partitions. The required
parameter corresponds to a space separated set of floating point
numbers, one for each of the constraints. For example, for three
constraints, the string can be "1.02 1.2 1.35" indicating a
desired maximum load imbalance of 2%, 20%, and 35%, respectively.
The load imbalance is defined in a way similar to ufactor.
If supplied, this parameter takes priority over ufactor.
.HP
\fB\-niter\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Specifies the number of iterations for the refinement algorithms
at each stage of the uncoarsening process. Default is 10.
.HP
\fB\-ncuts\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Specifies the number of different partitionings that it will compute.
The final partitioning is the one that achieves the best edgecut or
communication volume. Default is 1.
.HP
\fB\-nooutput\fR
.IP
Specifies that no partitioning file should be generated.
.HP
\fB\-seed\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Selects the seed of the random number generator.
.HP
\fB\-dbglvl\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Selects the dbglvl.
.HP
\fB\-help\fR
.IP
Prints this message.
