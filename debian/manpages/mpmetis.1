.SH NAME
mpmetis \- manual page for mpmetis 5.1.0
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mpmetis
[\fIoptions\fR] \fImeshfile nparts\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
Required parameters
.TP
meshfile
Stores the mesh to be partitioned.
.TP
nparts
The number of partitions to split the mesh.
.IP
Optional parameters
.HP
\fB\-gtype\fR=\fIstring\fR
.IP
Specifies the graph to be used for computing the partitioning
The possible values are:
.TP
dual
\- Partition the dual graph of the mesh [default]
.TP
nodal
\- Partition the nodal graph of the mesh
.HP
\fB\-ptype\fR=\fIstring\fR
.IP
Specifies the scheme to be used for computing the k\-way partitioning.
The possible values are:
.TP
rb
\- Recursive bisectioning
.TP
kway
\- Direct k\-way partitioning [default]
.HP
\fB\-ctype\fR=\fIstring\fR
.IP
Specifies the scheme to be used to match the vertices of the graph
during the coarsening.
The possible values are:
.TP
rm
\- Random matching
.TP
shem
\- Sorted heavy\-edge matching [default]
.HP
\fB\-iptype\fR=\fIstring\fR [applies only when \fB\-ptype\fR=\fIrb]\fR
.IP
Specifies the scheme to be used to compute the initial partitioning
of the graph.
The possible values are:
.TP
grow
\- Grow a bisection using a greedy strategy [default]
.TP
random
\- Compute a bisection at random
.HP
\fB\-objtype\fR=\fIstring\fR [applies only when \fB\-ptype\fR=\fIkway]\fR
.IP
Specifies the objective that the partitioning routines will optimize.
The possible values are:
.TP
cut
\- Minimize the edgecut [default]
.TP
vol
\- Minimize the total communication volume
.HP
\fB\-contig\fR [applies only when \fB\-ptype\fR=\fIkway]\fR
.IP
Specifies that the partitioning routines should try to produce
partitions that are contiguous. Note that if the input graph is not
connected this option is ignored.
.HP
\fB\-minconn\fR [applies only when \fB\-ptype\fR=\fIkway]\fR
.IP
Specifies that the partitioning routines should try to minimize the
maximum degree of the subdomain graph, i.e., the graph in which each
partition is a node, and edges connect subdomains with a shared
interface.
.HP
\fB\-tpwgts\fR=\fIfilename\fR
.IP
Specifies the name of the file that stores the target weights for
each partition. By default, all partitions are assumed to be of
the same size.
.HP
\fB\-ufactor\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Specifies the maximum allowed load imbalance among the partitions.
A value of x indicates that the allowed load imbalance is 1+x/1000.
For ptype=rb, the load imbalance is measured as the ratio of the
2*max(left,right)/(left+right), where left and right are the sizes
of the respective partitions at each bisection.
For ptype=kway, the load imbalance is measured as the ratio of
max_i(pwgts[i])/avgpwgt, where pwgts[i] is the weight of the ith
partition and avgpwgt is the sum of the total vertex weights divided
by the number of partitions requested.
For ptype=rb, the default value is 1 (i.e., load imbalance of 1.001).
For ptype=kway, the default value is 30 (i.e., load imbalance of 1.03).
.HP
\fB\-ncommon\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Specifies the common number of nodes that two elements must have
in order to put an edge between them in the dual graph. Default is 1.
.HP
\fB\-niter\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Specifies the number of iterations for the refinement algorithms
at each stage of the uncoarsening process. Default is 10.
.HP
\fB\-ncuts\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Specifies the number of different partitionings that it will compute.
The final partitioning is the one that achieves the best edgecut or
communication volume. Default is 1.
.HP
\fB\-nooutput\fR
.IP
Specifies that no partitioning file should be generated.
.HP
\fB\-seed\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Selects the seed of the random number generator.
.HP
\fB\-dbglvl\fR=\fIint\fR
.IP
Selects the dbglvl.
.HP
\fB\-help\fR
.IP
Prints this message.
