Description: Serial Graph Partitioning and Fill-reducing Matrix Ordering. Header
 METIS is a set of serial programs for partitioning graphs, partitioning finite
 element meshes, and producing fill reducing orderings for sparse matrices.
 The algorithms implemented in METIS are based on the multilevel
 recursive-bisection, multilevel k-way, and multi-constraint partitioning
 schemes. The package contains a header-file.

Description: Serial Graph Partitioning and Fill-reducing Matrix Ordering. Binaries
 METIS is a set of serial programs for partitioning graphs, partitioning finite
 element meshes, and producing fill reducing orderings for sparse matrices.
 The algorithms implemented in METIS are based on the multilevel
 recursive-bisection, multilevel k-way, and multi-constraint partitioning
 schemes. The package contains some binaries for graph analyzing.
